# oorexx-bugs

Continuous integration for patches to [ooRexx](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx/)
prepared by Josep Maria Blasco: each workflow takes ooRexx trunk from
SourceForge's SVN, applies a patch set from `patches/`, builds it, and runs
the ooRexx test suite, next to an unpatched build of the same revision.

| Patch set | What | Ticket |
|---|---|---|
| `rfe-881` | `RexxCallBack`, Regina-compatible: an external function calls a label of the running program | [RFE #881](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/feature-requests/881/) |
